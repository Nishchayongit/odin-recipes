    <h1>TANDOORI CHICKEN</h1>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS REQUIRED</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> I prefer using chicken leg quarters for this recipe because they are fatty, flavorful, and have the bone intact. You can also use a mix of chicken legs and drumsticks. If you want boneless chicken, opt for chicken thighs.
Yogurt.</li> <li>Plain Greek yogurt or natural yogurt. Please do not use flavored yogurt.</li>
<li>Lemon juice. Optional, but if your yogurt is NOT on the tard side, add 1 teaspoon of lemon or lime juice.</li>
<li> Ginger and garlic. Freshly minced. Fresh ginger and garlic give the chicken Asian notes and add great flavor. Use fewer or more garlic cloves, depending on your preferences. </li>
<li>Spices. The spice blend I prefer using for my tandoori chicken recipe consists of garam masala, cumin, cinnamon, ground coriander, turmeric, and smoked paprika. While you can customize the spice blend for tandoori chicken, I recommend you never skip the garam masala, as it gives the dish an authentic Indian feel.</li> 
<li>Olive oil. For the marinade. You can use butter or ghee, but I find it firms up a little too much for my liking.</li>
<li>Salt. To taste. </li>

    </ul>
